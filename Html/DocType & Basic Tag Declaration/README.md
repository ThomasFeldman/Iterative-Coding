Each Day I'm going to do 20 until I hit 1k
I'll delete the 20 files I did from the previous day and just name the files as the next set of numbers
So the first day there will be 20 files "1-20", day 2 there will be 20 files "21-40" and so on till I hit 1k.

The purpose of this is not to give myself carpal tunnel but rather to get the code so engrained that it becomes automatic..
