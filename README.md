# Iterative-Coding

## What is Iterative Coding?

This is my repo where I'm going to push my coding drills. I'm working to solidify my knowledge in basic coding syntax.

A lot of these things that I'm going to put in this repo are things that I already "know", I understand a lot of syntax but I don't have it down to the point where I don't have to think about it. A lot of basic code is not yet second nature, so I'm going to work on getting it to be second nature.

## Structure of this Repo

In this repo I'm going to separate my code into different folders for different languages and then I'll have folders inside those to show exactly what I'm practicing ex. Iterative-Coding/JavaScript/forLoops, or Iterative-Coding/CSS/navBar, etc. The point of this is to pin point one specific aspect of programming that I want to experiment with or memorize and to drill it over and over.

## What I mean by Drilling

If I wanted to memorize the structure of a basic for loop, I would first make a "demo" file that has exactly what it should look like, and then I'd make a new file for each for loop I write from memory. Doing this I believe would make the standard syntax of writing a for loop almost second nature.
Now this works for memorizing syntax, but what about concepts? This is where I will experiment with the code. Most of this will probably be not great to look at or not optimized but the point of this will be to learn what works and what doesn't work.

## Takeaways from this repo

This is not really meant to showcase any kind of coding skills, this is pure practice. So the files in here will be sometimes incomplete, ugly, or just plain repetative. This is the sketchbook, not the finished drawing. So don't judge too harshly when looking at this repo I'm not going to be googling anything here so it will be rough.

## Additional resources on the benefits of iterative practice

Ultralearning by Scott Young is a great book that touches on some of the concepts I will be using here.

[Here is a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ufz75UvHs&list=PLd7W4lM8E1yel7vnrcCyBQxATgnoCT9xw) to a video on iterative practice applied to drawing that I found extremely interesting and the applications are obviously transposable to other skills like programming.
